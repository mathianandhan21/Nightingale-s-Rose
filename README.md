There were two html files in this project. Each using the same visualization type for different dataset.

First html (testedsamples.html) -  The purpose of choosing this masterpiece for this dataset is that it helps the viewer to easily compare the increase / decrease in tested samples across the year with separate segments for the samples that were tested positive and negative.

Second html(dosestaken.html) - This visualization helps the viewer to compare the doses taken by public across the year 2021 (JAN-AUG).It helps to analyse which month has the most vaccination done and which month most people took complete vaccination (i.e) second dose.
