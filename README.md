Nightingale's Rose
==================

<a href="http://www.d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> visualization of the famous polar area diagram from Florence Nightingale's  

<b>Dataset Used :</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india" target="_blank"> COVID details of INDIA (Kaggle)</a>

It includes the tested samples across different states , the number of doses taken for the time period of Jan 2020 till Aug 2021 and the no. of cured and confirmed cases across the time period of APR 2020 till MAR 2021"</a>. 

Have referred the following work for this implementation:

There were three html files in this project. Each using the same visualization type for different dataset.

<b>First html (testedsamples.html) -  Dataset used here is the samples tested in INDIA across 2020 and 2021</b>

This Rose chart depicts the number of samples tested across a period of one year (i.e) April 2020 - March 2021.

The graphic shows that the total samples tested in 2020 were much fewer than those tested in the months of 2021.

In other words, as 2020 comes to a close and into the next year, awareness of the Covid test and its preventive actions increases.

The samples that tested positive are another crucial observation. October (2020) and August (2020) had the most positive samples ever observed.

An important association that has been seen is that as the number of samples tested rises, which indicates that more people are aware of Covid, it also causes a drop in Covid positively tested results in 2021 as compared to 2020.


<b>Second html(dosestaken.html) - Dataset used here is the no. of doses taken by public across in year 2021(JAN-AUG)</b>

This visualization helps the viewer to compare the doses taken by public across the year 2021 (JAN-AUG).

It appears that doses taken were gradually increased over the course of the year.

It helps to analyse which month has the most vaccination done and which month most people took complete vaccination (i.e) second dose.

The highest number of doses consumed and highest number of second doses taken both occurred in JUL-2021.


<b>Third html(covidcases.html) - Dataset used here is the no. of cases registered in year 2020( From April) till 2021(March)</b>

This visualization helps the viewer to compare the cases registered across different months.

It seems like cured cases were registered very lesser in 2020 as it is the intial period of COVID .

Although no effective medication was discovered during the early 2020, confirmed instances were also significantly more common than cured cases. 

Beginning at the end of 2020 and continuing through 2021, the gap between cases that were cured and those that were confirmed was narrowing.

It also implies that more instances were hospitalized during the later 2020 and earlier 2021.
